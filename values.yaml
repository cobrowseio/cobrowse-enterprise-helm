# Persistent Volume Storage
storage:
  # * class: "class-name" - Supports dynamic provisioning when you have a
  #                         specific storage class available, such as "nfs"
  # * class: "null"       - Supports static provisioning. You should
  #                         configure your own statically-provisioned PVC
  #                         resource with name "cobrowse-sockets-pvc", and
  #                         accompanying PV resource
  #                       - Also supports pre-configured PVC. You can
  #                         set the sockets.storage.persistentVolumeClaimName
  #                         and recording.storage.persistentVolumeClaimName
  #                         values to reference any pre-configured PVC(s)
